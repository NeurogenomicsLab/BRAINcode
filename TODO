1. xyplot for all replicates with +1 pseudocount e.g. log(x+1)  ==> done! 
2. HTNE for non-neuronal, and pyramidal neurons
3. correlation for eRNA and GENCODE genes  -- send data to GL
4. running - merge Histone data from Roadmap --> using peaks called from merged samples to infer HTNE classification

[Tue Aug 11 14:11:20 EDT 2015]
1. eQTL for eRNA -- to check the job status of 10k permutations and run permutations
2. correlation for eRNA and GENCODE genes  -- send data to GL
3. GO for each of categories in heatmap format
4. super-regulated genes and super-enriched genes?
5. method & result for above

[Tue Aug  4 18:05:59 EDT 2015]
1. testing cufflinks in /PHShome/xd010/neurogen/rnaseq_PD/run_output/HC_BN12-44_SNDA_6_rep1.stranded/uniq, which genes.fpkm_tracking does not include ENSG00000199071 and ENSG00000122728. JOBID: 910559
2. enhancer-being testï¼š
(1). ENHANCER state from chromHMM enrichment in each HiTNE categories
(2) H3k4me1 vs. H3k4me3 in HiTNE vs. promoter
(3) P300 TF enrichment
(4) CAGE bi-directionality in HiTNEs

[Sat Dec 20 01:43:01 EST 2014]
1. continue until the bsub jobs are done in CAGE.pipeline.sh

[Thu Nov  6 14:04:20 EST 2014]
1. to check the bayesembler run in both hms and hpc server
2. integrate http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/#

[Sat Nov  1 12:52:16 EDT 2014]
1. to remake the coviance table: /PHShome/xd010/neurogen/rnaseq_PD/rawfiles/covariances.tab  (CHECK with ZL: BN11-54 miss sex	age	PMI)
2. to test PEER

[Tue Oct 21 18:33:47 EDT 2014]
to make QC merits for all samples, including fastqc etc.
